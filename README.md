## ⭐ What is it?

Mark as Seen Submod addresses the problem many people have with unwanted pooled
topics showing on on the 'Unseen' menu and either feel tempting to try (such as
*'You are murderer!'* or *'Do you want to meet my girlfriend?'*) or prone to
misclicking (especially when MAS lags a little) by letting you hide certain
topics from the 'Unseen' menu.

## #️⃣ Tested versions

**Note:** no guarantees are provided that the submod will be functional or even
compatible with further MAS updates. In case of any issues with it after an
update, please [create an issue about it](https://github.com/friends-of-monika/mas-mark-as-seen/issues/create)
(make sure to include all traceback and errors) and [temporarily remove the submod](#-how-do-i-uninstall-it)
to make sure your game is functional again. We will update the submod as soon as
possible once an incompatible MAS update is out!

> *✅ Compatible* &mdash; we have tested the submod and we guarantee the stability
and functionality of the submod when installed onto this version (or any
version in range)<br>
> *⚠️ Untested* &mdash; we haven't looked into the submod's behavior when
installed onto this version (or any version in range)

| Version            | Compatibility |
|--------------------|---------------|
| 0.12.12 to 0.12.14 | ✅ Compatible |
| 0.12.11 and below  | ⚠️ Untested   |

## 📦 How do I install it?

1. Go to [the latest release page](https://github.com/friends-of-monika/mas-mark-as-seen/releases/latest),
   scroll to the bottom and download the `fom_mark_as_seen.rpy` file.
2. Drop this file to the `game/Submods` folder inside your DDLC install location.
3. You're all set!

## 🔥 How do I uninstall it?

Delete the `fom_mark_as_seen.rpy` file from your `game/Submods` folder along with
its associated `.rpyc` file, too. Once done, the submod will be safely removed
from your game and will no longer have any effect.

## ❓ Questions you may ask

### 🤔 How do I use it?

Once installed, you'll have a button added to the 'Unseen' menu, which you can
use to hide or show topics on it. Topics that are checked will show up on the
menu, and unchecked topics will be hidden from it.

### 😰 I hid all the topics and now the Unseen menu is hidden!

When the Unseen menu is hidden because there is nothing on it, you can still
edit it using the `I would like to edit the 'Unseen' menu` topic in `You`
category.

### 🔧 Does Mark as Seen interfere with other submods?

We have designed the submod in a way that will not affect topics directly nor
it shall interfer with other submods (unless they're also doing something with
the Talk and Unseen menu) &mdash; so with 99.99% of the submods out there, this
should be working fine and cause no trouble whatsoever.
